Kevin Tetteh and Daniel Ward recently visited the Ministry of Public Health in Thailand, and trained their staff in serological methods and Oxford Nanopore sequencing, as part of funded TB and COVID-19 projects (photo attached). Members of the Ministry of Public Health are visiting the LSHTM during July/August. Please contact Taane Clark if keen to meet with them.
