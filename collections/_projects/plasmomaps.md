Plasmo Maps is a web-based tool that visualises and analyses the Plasmodium variant data, gathered by the team at LSHTM and collaborators. Plasmo Maps has the aim to allow users of all backgrounds to understand the variant data, and to assist in the eradication efforts currently underway. By improving the understanding of the complexity and variability of Plasmodium parasites and assisting in the areas of surveillance and drug discovery, we are well on the way to reach the world health organisation's goal to reduce malaria cases by 90% by 2050.
